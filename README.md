# 🚀 Hybrid Simulation of Distributed Process Systems

> A dynamic, event-driven simulation benchmark using hybrid systems, OpenFOAM, and Python.

## 📘 Overview

In high-fidelity modeling of distributed interconnected process systems, solving 3D PDEs in real-time can be a **computational nightmare**. This project tackles the challenge by introducing a **Hybrid Systems Approach** that drastically cuts computational load **without sacrificing accuracy**.

> 🧠 **Core Idea**: Simulate the event-driven dynamics of interconnected process systems with changing geometry using hybrid modeling techniques and object-oriented simulation principles.

## 🧪 Benchmark System

We model a **single-phase water tank** with:
- Trapped air inside
- Two discharge valves
- Event-driven geometry updates

This setup serves as a simplified yet powerful representation of **holdup elements** found in most chemical processes.

## 🛠 Tools & Tech

```bash
📦 OpenFOAM       # For CFD-based dynamic simulation
🐍 Python          # For macros and event-driven geometry updates
💡 Hybrid Systems  # For modeling multi-logic dynamical behavior
🧱 Object-Oriented # For scalable, modular simulation structure
